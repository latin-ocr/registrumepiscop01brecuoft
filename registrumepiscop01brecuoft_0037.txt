PREFACE. xiii

Mr. Chalmers has made no notes on the names and dates of
Bishops after the Reformation, which it may be convenient to
add here, chiefly from Keith—

1. Alexander Campbell, 1566, a son of ArdkinlaS‚ appointed
while yet a child, died in 1606

2. Andrew Lamb‚ previously Minister at Bruntisland‚ Bishop
of Brechin, 16063 translated to Galloway‚ 1619. “ He was one

of the three Bishops who went by the King’s order into Eng-
land‚ where he received Episcopal consecrati0n‚ on the 20th
October, 1610.’

3. David Lindsay‚ son of Colonel John Lindsay, a brother
of the house of Edzell, consecrated at St. AndreWS, 23d Novem—
ber, 16193 translated to Edinburgh, 1634.

4. Thomas Sydserf, afterwards better known as 'Bishop of
Galloway and Bishop of Orkney, was Bishop of Brechin in 1633
though omitted by Keith.l

5. W alter Whitford, son of James Whitford of that ilk, pre-
xviously Minister of Monkland‚ and Sub· dean of Glasgow, then
Rector of Moffat3 made Bishop of Brechin, 1635. He retained
his Sub-deanery in commendam. Deprived by the General As—
sembly in 1633: “after which he fied into England, as being
reckoned a forward man for the Liturgy and Book ‚Of Canons3
and there he died in the year 1643.⁷’ Keith appears not to have
known that, after the Glasgow Assembly‚ 1638, the King pre-
sented Bishop Whitford to the living of Waldegrave in Nor·
thamptonshire.²
