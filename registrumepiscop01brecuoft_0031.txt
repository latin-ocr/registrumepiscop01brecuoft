PREFACE. vii

7. In 1247, Pope Innocent IV. ordered the consecration of
Albinus, formerly Precentor (?) of the Cathedral, who had been
elected by the Chapter, Bishop of Brechin, dispensing with his
illegitimacy.1 Albinus enumeratos as his predecessors Turpin,
Ralph, Hugh, and Gregory. In 1248 Albinus witnessed, and had
evidently promoted, the foundation of the Maison Dieu by William
de Brechin, grandson of David, Earl of Huntingdon. Albinus,
Bishop of Brechin, by charter dated at Finchale, in 1248, granted
an indulgence to all who should help the building of the new
church of the Priory of Finchale3 and by a charter dated at
Durham 4th March, 1256, a similar indulgence to those visiting
any of the five altars in front of the Church of Durhamf‘· He
is known, also, from transactions with the Monks of Arbroath,
and he died Bishop in 1269.3

8. The next steps are uncertain3 but a chronicle‚ not of the
highest authority,‘² has perhaps given the account most recon-
’ cilable with record. On the death of Albinus, William Dean
of Brechin, a man of excellent character, but of a harsh voice,
was elected by the Chapter. The Legate refused him confirma-
tion, but on appeal the Pope at once granted it. William, elect
of Brechin, died in 1274 in the Council at LyonS, and Friar
William, of the Friars Preachers (Hector fratrum predicatorum
de Perth),⁴= was elected Bishop of Brechin, who refused the See
on account of the smallness of the revenues.
