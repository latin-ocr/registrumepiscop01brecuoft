PREFACE. xxvii

hardly any. He had to furnish himself with the dictionaries and
grammars of a new language and science, and that at a distance
from advice, as well as from booksellers’ shops. But these diffi-
culties were, with ChalmerS, only incitements to persevere. In a
short time he gathered round him a capital archaeological library‚
to which he was continually adding, and which in no long time
he knew well how to turn to use. He corresponded‚ and be-
came personally acquainted with most students of his country
engaged in similar pursuitS‚ and his acquaintances soon became
friends. He stood very well with his country neighbours, and he
used his popularity for obtaining access to every charter-room in
his county, and made notes of all. His house became the plea-
sant haunt of many an antiquary and scholar, giving and taking
knowledge. This was 30, even when his thread of life seemed
worn to a fibre; but, before the end of the nine years of habitual
sickneSS, though still restricted to his own house, he had, in some
measure, recovered strength and the power of locomotion, and
was able to enjoy a more general intercourse.

Aldbar was then the centre of a very cultivated society. Along
with country neighbours and English friends were to be found
Scotchmen of his own pursuitS‚ foreign antiquari‘es, artists, and
scholars. A ll men of education or accomplishment were welcome:
for he could appreciate intellect, however directed, and merit in

any dress. His reputation as a local antiquary brought round him
and imbued with his tasteS, neighbours who had never dreamt of

antiquities before,—-the Laird curious about a family picture or
pedigree‚ the Parson desirous of information as to teind or glebe.
