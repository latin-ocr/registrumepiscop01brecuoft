PREFAOE. xxi

favourite foundation of the Trinity Churoh of Edinburgh; and
one of the latest is the Taxt Roll of the County of Forfar
divided into its four QUARTERs—of Dundee, of Kerrimure, of
Brecffin, and of Arbroath‚ as declared by Parliamentary Com—

missioners in 1614.l

A household or wardrobe account of E‘lward 1.
has the following payments—

To Gerard Dor and John de la Moille for
sulphur for burning the Castle of Breghyn in
August, 1303, iiis.

To Robert of Westminster for a wooden eof-
fer delivered to John of Hauekele, clerk, for eon—
taining the chartas, wrifings, and other memo-
randa found in the Oastle os Breghin‚ 26 Feb-
ruary, ii s. vj d.'

The same record contains payments of :2640
to a valet of the Queen, for his labour in the
making of a war wolf (lupi quern) for the storm-
ing of Stirh'ng Gastle wall, and :640 to John de
la Muillie (valletto hospicii Reqis) for his labour
about making the Greek fire for burning the*
houses of the castle.

¹ Ι wish Mr. Chalmers had told us something
more of the origin or antiquity, and the boun-
darien of these Quarters, each of which had its
Mair or officer, to whom the Sheriff looked for
executing his writs. Os the great Sheriffdom it-
self I find a few notes which, imperfect as they
are, may be interesting to the gentry of the
county.
