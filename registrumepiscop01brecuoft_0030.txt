fective. Spottiswood threw into it his usual amount of errem,
and Keith had not materials to correct them. It is the more to
be regretted that a careful search has discovered no continuous
work of Mr. Chalmers’ on the subject. A few hasty notes on
the margin of his ⁶ Keith’ are all that have been found to throw
any light on it. With the help of these, the following list has
been prepared, which, however imperfect, and in some places

conjectural, is better than those hitherto published :—
The See founded c. 1150.

1. Τ. Bishop, c. 1155-6.

2. Sampon, c. 1158.

3. Turpin, elect 11783 was probably consecrated in that
year, and may have been Bishop till 1198.

4. Ralph was elect in 11983 consecrated 1202.

5. His successor probably was Hugh, who, styles Ralph his
predecessor,1 and who must have been Bishop of Brechin in 1214,
since one of his charters is witnessed by Robert Elect of Ross,
who was so designated in that year. Hugh died in 1218.

6. Gregory the archdeacon succeeded‚ who enumerates Tur—
pin, Ralph, and Hugh, as his predecessors in the Bishoprick of
Brechin He continued Bishop till 1246.

(Gilbert is said to have died Bishop of Brechin in 1249 ; suc-

ceeded by his Archdeacon Robert, perhaps through confusion
of a former event in the See) ³
