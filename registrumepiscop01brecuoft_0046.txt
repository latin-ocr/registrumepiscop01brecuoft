xxii PREFAOE.

One deed‚ the grant of a toft and croft in Kincardin,¹ with
liberty of hrewing and> baking and of all else pertaining to
a free hostellry, recalls the curicus tenures that sometimes
gathered round our Royal dwellings. The Oastle of Kincardin,
an abode of our earlier monarchS, was surrounded by little tene-
ments appropriated for the dwelling and support of the retainers
of the court 3 and many of these retained the names of the officers
whose appanage they were.2 Another deed, a Crowu charter
of the Hermitage of Kilgerry,3 opens a humbler piece of Augus
local history. Hugh Cuminche was the Hermit, and possessed
the hermitage of St. Mary's Chapel of the Forest of Kilgerry
in the barony of Menmuir, by a heredita& title, together with
the croft, the green, and three acres of arable land. These he
resigned in the hands of the Sovereign, who regranted them to
John Smyth, citizen of Brechin, on 12 May, 1445, for payment
of services used and wont‚ and with a special reservation of the
accustomed benefit of the H ermit’s prayerS. It does not appear
that John Smyth was qualified to perform this part of the Red-
dendo, or to serve in the Forest Chapel of the Virgin ; the ruins
of which, till lately, existed in the vicinity of a fine spring, still
known as the Lady Well.4 The Erechin citizen sold the hermit-
